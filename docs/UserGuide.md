ClientHub is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ClientHub can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClientHub.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar clienthub.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/likes ramen` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Client Hub.

   * `delete John Doe` : Deletes John Doe from the Client Hub.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/CLIENT_TYPE]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/Plan A` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CLIENT_TYPE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `c/Plan A`, `c/Plan A c/Plan B` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

    * Name written before / must be **EXACT** name of the contact to be deleted.
    * Order matters when using / to delete a contact.

A **valid** `NAME` for delete should:
* Not be empty.

  * Typing `view John` will **throw an error** if there is `John Doe` and `John Doey` in the contact list.
  * Typing `view John` if there is only `John Doe` in the contact list will **create a popup view** of `John Doe`.

The command history feature allows users to easily navigate through previously entered commands using the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys. This is helpful for quickly accessing past commands without needing to retype them.

* **Up** Arrow: Moves to the previous command in the history.
* **Down** Arrow: Moves to the next command in the history.

This feature enables efficient command recall, streamlining the process of repeating or editing previous inputs.

### Saving the data

ClientHub data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ClientHub data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/clienthub.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClientHub will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ClientHub to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClientHub home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
