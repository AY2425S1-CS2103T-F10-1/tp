3. Type `cd Downloads/[FolderName]` and press Enter
4. Type `java -jar clienthub.jar` and press Enter


   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/likes ramen` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Client Hub.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/CLIENT_TYPE]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/Plan A` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items that are **not** in square brackets are compulsory.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME` must be used as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CLIENT_TYPE]…​` can be used as ` `, `c/Plan A`, `c/Plan A c/Plan B` etc. (i.e. 0 or more times, since it is a optional field) <br>
  e.g. `c/CLIENT_TYPE…​`can be used as `c/Plan A`, `c/Plan A c/Plan B` etc. (i.e. 1 or more times, since it is compulsory)

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Add `$` after the input name to indicate **exact** name.<br>
  * This is useful when a client's name is a prefix of another client's name.

  e.g. `delete John Doe$` will delete the contact with the name `John Doe`.<br>
  e.g. If there are two client named `David Li` and `David Lim`, typing `delete David Li$` will delete the client with the name `David Li`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `sort` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

#### Note
* `NAME` is **case-insensitive**. The first letter of every word will be automatically converted to capital letter and the rest to small letters. This is
to ensure that 2 names with the same letters but different cases are not considered as different names. 

    e.g. `john doe` and `John Doe` are considered the same name and cannot be added as 2 different clients.

* `CLIENT_TYPE` is **case-senstive**. This is to give greater flexibility to differentiate between different client types that are similar but have different cases.

    e.g. `Health` is different from `hEaLtH` while `Investment` and `Investment` are the same and are considered duplicates



### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/DESCRIPTION] [c/CLIENT_TYPE]…​`

* The fields constraints are the same as the `add` command.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
  * At most 1 of each field can be edited at a time.(excluding CLIENT_TYPE)

### Deleting a client: `delete`

Deletes the specified person from ClientHub.

Format: `delete NAME` or `d NAME` or `delete NAME$`

      * Eg. if there are 2 contacts named `David Li` and `David Lim`, typing `delete David Li` will throw an error.
    * However, deleting David Lim does not require `$` as it is already the **MOST** specific name.
    * Name written before `$` must be **EXACT** name of the contact to be deleted.
    * Order matters when using `$` to delete a contact.

Examples:
* `delete John Doe` deletes the person named `John Doe`

* The command is case-insensitive. eg. `alice` will match `Alice`
* The command does a `find` and displays the popup view only if the no. of clients found is exactly 1.
* If duplicates are found, `view` will throw an error telling user to specify the name further.
    * For eg. if 2 contacts have names such as "David Li" and "David Lim", typing `view David` will throw an error.
* Executing another `view` command will change the contents of the popup view to the new specified client.

Examples:
* `view John Doe` shows the contact named `John Doe`
* `view John` will throw an error if there is `John Doe` and `John Doey` in the list of contacts.

## Additional Features
### Command History Navigation
The command history feature allows users to easily navigate through previously entered commands using the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys. This is helpful for quickly accessing past commands without needing to retype them.

* **Up** Arrow: Moves to the previous command in the history.
* **Down** Arrow: Moves to the next command in the history.

This feature enables efficient command recall, streamlining the process of repeating or editing previous inputs.

### Saving the data

ClientHub data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes
the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ClientHub data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/clienthub.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClientHub will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ClientHub to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClientHub home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
